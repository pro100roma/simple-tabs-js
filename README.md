Optimized, responsive, easy to use tabs made in JavaScript. Without jQuery!

In order to use it in your project, you just need to insert the necessary classes from your HTML markup into the script when declared a variable here:


let tab = document.querySelectorAll('.info-header-tab'), //Clickable Tab
    info = document.querySelector('.info-header'), //Block-wrap with tabs (for delegation)
    tabContent = document.querySelectorAll('.info-tabcontent'); //Content for each tab
    
    
Also you can just copy my HTML and paste to your markup in order for the script to work exactly.  

Thank you for visiting my Github page, you can check another scripts on this profile. I think that they will be useful to you in your projects!

Bye and good luck!
